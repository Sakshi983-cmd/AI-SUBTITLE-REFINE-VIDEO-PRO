IMPORTANT — Follow exactly:
- Keep these file names and paths exactly (case-sensitive):
  - assets/flowchart.svg
  - assets/screenshot.png
  - assets/avatar.png

Do not rename or move them.

---

## Flowchart (black)
![Flowchart](assets/flowchart.svg)

---

## Proof / Screenshot (KEEP THIS EXACT NAME: assets/screenshot.png)
![Screenshot proof](assets/screenshot.png)

(Upload your screenshot here as `assets/screenshot.png` so it shows in README as proof.)

---

## Project avatar / logo (KEEP EXACT NAME: assets/avatar.png)
![Avatar](assets/avatar.png)

(Upload your avatar image here as `assets/avatar.png`.)

---

## Quick checklist if images do NOT show
1. Files are committed & pushed to the same branch shown on GitHub (usually `main`):
   - git add assets/flowchart.svg assets/screenshot.png assets/avatar.png README.md
   - git commit -m "Add README and assets (flowchart, screenshot, avatar)"
   - git push origin main

2. Case-sensitive path: `assets/flowchart.svg` (not `Assets` or `ASSETS`).

3. Check raw URL in browser to confirm file exists:
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sakshi983-cmd/AI-SUBTITLE-REFINE-VIDEO-PRO/main/assets/flowchart.svg
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sakshi983-cmd/AI-SUBTITLE-REFINE-VIDEO-PRO/main/assets/screenshot.png
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sakshi983-cmd/AI-SUBTITLE-REFINE-VIDEO-PRO/main/assets/avatar.png

4. If any raw URL gives 404, the file is either not pushed or path/branch is wrong.

---

## Git commands (exact)
git add assets/flowchart.svg assets/screenshot.png assets/avatar.png README.md  
git commit -m "Add README and assets (flowchart, screenshot, avatar)"  
git push origin main

---

Bas ab aap: 1) `assets/` folder mein yeh 3 files daalo (flowchart.svg maine neeche de di hai; screenshot & avatar aap apna upload karo) 2) commit & push 3) visit your repo README on GitHub — images should show. Agar phir bhi nahi aaye, mujhe batao exact error/404 URL main check kar dunga.
